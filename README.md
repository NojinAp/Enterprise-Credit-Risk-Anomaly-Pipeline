# Business Partner Credit Risk - Anomaly Detection Pipeline

An end-to-end data engineering pipeline that pulls live accounts receivable data from SAP S/4HANA via OData API, transforms it through a Medallion Architecture using PySpark, and runs two complementary anomaly detection methods to surface high-risk business partners for financial investigation.

```

Partners flagged by **both** methods are highest-confidence. Each method catches different patterns - agreement is a strong signal.

## Feature Engineering

19 features are computed per business partner before detection runs:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `TotalTransactions` | Count of all transactions |
| `TotalAmount` / `AvgAmount` | Sum and mean of absolute transaction amounts |
| `MaxSingleAmount` | Largest single transaction |
| `AmountVolatility` | Coefficient of variation (std / mean) |
| `UniqueDocTypes` | Diversity of SAP document types used |
| `UniqueMainTransactions` | Diversity of transaction types |
| `UniqueContracts` | Number of distinct contract accounts |
| `ReversalRatio` | ZC reversal docs relative to AC credit docs - primary fraud signal |
| `NettedPairsCount` | Matched AC/ZC cancellation pairs (excluded from credit totals) |
| `Balance` / `TotalDebit` | Outstanding financial exposure |
| `AvgDaysOverdue` / `MaxDaysOverdue` | Overdue profile |
| `HighValueCount` / `ExtremeValueCount` | Transactions above $10k / $100k thresholds |
| `AvgROSScore` / `MaxROSScore` | Proximity of amounts to internal authority limit boundaries |
| `RoundTransactionRate` | Fraction of round-number transactions - classic fraud indicator |

All detection runs **within peer groups** (Segment × TransactionType) so a partner is compared to genuine peers, not the full population.

## Detection Methods

### IQR Scoring

For each feature, computes how many IQRs above Q3 a partner sits within their peer group. A partner scoring above the multiplier threshold on any feature is flagged. Fully explainable - the flag reason names the specific features that triggered.

### Isolation Forest

Trains an Isolation Forest on all 19 features within each peer group independently. Catches multivariate anomalies that no single feature would reveal - e.g. a partner with moderate amounts but an unusual combination of high reversal ratio, high volatility, and many round transactions.

### Configuration

All thresholds live in [src/config.py](src/config.py) - no magic numbers in pipeline code:

```python
iqr_multiplier = 2.0
isolation_forest_contamination = 0.05
high_value_threshold = 10_000.0
extreme_value_threshold = 100_000.0
suspicious_reversal_ratio = 5.0
alert_cooldown_days = 30
```

## Key Results

- **1,031 high-risk partners flagged** from 616,248 transactions across the accounts receivable portfolio
- **Reversal ratios exceeding 1,000×** on several partners - systematic billing reversals requiring investigation
- **Single transactions above $15M** surfaced for manual review
- **Negative balances exceeding $39M** identified as significant outstanding exposure
- **One partner with 17,743 transactions and a reversal ratio of 17,728×** - far outside all peer group norms
- Peer-group z-scores surfaced partners that appear normal in absolute terms but are statistical outliers within their cohort

## Quickstart

> **Note:** The pipeline connects to an internal SAP S/4HANA environment. External users need to provide their own OData endpoint and credentials in `.env`. All transformation and detection logic is fully reusable with any SAP S/4HANA instance.

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd anomaly-detection-upgraded
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your SAP credentials
docker-compose up
```

Airflow UI: `http://localhost:8080`

### Local

**Prerequisite:** Java 17+ must be installed - required by PySpark.

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/sap_odata_connector.py   # ingest
python src/staging.py               # bronze → silver
python src/curated.py               # silver → gold + detection

jupyter notebook                    # open notebooks/02_features_and_model.ipynb
```
